IDE | **Visual Studio Code:** Blends the ease of use of a source code editor with advanced developer features such as IntelliSense code completion and debugging.| **PyCharm:** is an integrated development environment (IDE) for the Python programming language. Code analysis, a graphical debugger, and an integrated unit testing are all included.
Operating System | **Linux:** is a kernel or operating system that is released under an open-source license. Its feature set is very similar to that of UNIX. | **Windows:** it has been developed by microsoft as a desktop operating system. Windows has been the most popular operating system for personal computers for the past three decades.
Version-control platform | **GitHub:** provides developers with the ability to store, manage, track, and control their code via a website and cloud-based service. | **GitLab:** For major DevOps and DevSecOps projects, it's an open source code repository and collaborative software development platform.

* **Visual Studio Code VS Pycharm & why I chose vscode**

**Visual Studio Code** blends the ease of use of a source code editor with advanced developer features such as IntelliSense code completion and debugging.

It is, first and foremost, an editor who stays out of your way. You'll spend less time fussing with your surroundings and more time implementing your ideas thanks to the delightfully frictionless edit-build-debug cycle.

When compared to PyCharm, Visual Studio Code is substantially faster. Also as opposed to PyCharm, it's a breeze to handle. Visual Studio Code is the clear winner when it comes to a modular approach to wiring code.

* **Linux (Ubuntu distribution) VS Windows & why I chose linux**

Because of the numerous libraries, examples, and tutorials, Ubuntu is the finest operating system for developers.

Ubuntu also offers enough support for the most recent releases of free open source software and platforms.

When compared to Windows, Ubuntu offers a more secure and private operating system solution. The best thing about Ubuntu is that we can get the essential privacy and security without having to rely on a third-party solution. Using this distribution, the risk of hacking and other types of assaults can be reduced.

* **GitHub VS GitLab & why I chose GitHub**

The platform each concept presents is the main distinction between GitHub and GitLab. GitLab is more focused on giving a features-based system with a centralized, integrated platform for web developers, whereas GitHub offers superior availability and is more focused on infrastructure performance.

Working on a huge project in conjunction with several developers? GitHub may be the best option.
