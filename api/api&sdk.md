# APIs and SDK

## API types

**1- Public APIs:** are freely accessible by developers and other users.

**2- Partner APIs:** APIs made available by/to strategic business partners. They are not accessible to the general public and require specific authorization.

**3- private APIs:** External users have no access to them, and only internal systems have access to them.

**4- Composite APIs:** Multiple data or service APIs can be combined.

## Benefits of APIs

**1- Increases productivity:**

APIs are a valuable tool for accelerating development. Instead of designing solutions from the ground up, developers can use APIs to swiftly apply existing functionality.

**2- Saves costs:**

The opportunity to save money is one of the most significant advantages of APIs for businesses. Using APIs to construct applications is a wonderful method to cut expenses because they greatly reduce development work.

**3- Improves marketing:**

Enterprises can boost their marketing efforts by exposing APIs. They enable them to broaden their reach and enter new markets that they would not have been able to enter otherwise.

**4- Collects data for intelligence analytics:**

APIs may provide a simple and rapid approach for businesses to extract value from data if they are used seriously. You can track and analyze how third-party developers use APIs by establishing them and releasing them to the public. This gives you valuable information on how customers engage with your items.

## The differences between API and SDK

An API is a collection of libraries that make up the core language and can be used right away, whereas an SDK is a development kit that makes it easier to use an API. Both are, in theory, ways for your application to communicate with and control resources offered by another piece of software.

The fundamental distinction is that an API is merely an interface for a service, whereas an SDK is a collection of tools, components, and code fragments built for a specific purpose.
